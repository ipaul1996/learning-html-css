Some inheritance properties, like color, are inherited from parent element if no value 
is specified. For example, color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height etc.

Other properties are not inherited and instead have default intial values. For example,
border, margin, padding, background-color, text-align etc.

If a css property does not inherited to the child element we can make it inherit by 
specifing the following,
p {
  border: inherit;
}

In general,
Properties that relate to text styling and font properties are typically inherited.
Properties related to layout, dimensions, box model (e.g., margins, paddings), and visual elements (e.g., background, borders) are usually not inherited.
