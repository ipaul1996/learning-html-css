Some inheritance properties, like color, are inherited from parent element if no value 
is specified. For example, color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height etc.

Other properties are not inherited and instead have default intial values. For example,
border, margin, padding, background-color, text-align etc.

If a css property does not inherited to the child element we can make it inherit by 
specifing the following,
p {
  border: inherit;
}
