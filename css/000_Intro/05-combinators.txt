The CSS combinators allow us to combine multiple selectors to target specific elements in the DOM.

Types of Combinators in CSS:

The combinators are of 4 types, which are given below:
1. `Descendant combinator ( ) (space)`
2. `Child combinator (>)`
3. `General sibling combinator (~)`
4. `Adjacent sibling combinator (+)`

Descendant combinator(represented by a single space (" ") character --> A B): Selects all 
elements matched by B that are descendants of elements matched by A. It targets 
elements that are nested within another element, regardless of how deep they are 
nested. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
`div p` selects all <p> elements that are descendants of <div> elements.


Child combinator (">" --> A > B): Selects all elements matched by B that are children of elements 
matched by A. Descendant elements further down the hierarchy don't match.
`div > p` selects all <p> elements that are direct children of <div> elements.


General sibling combinator/Subsequent-sibling combinator ("~" --> A ~ B): Selects all elements matched 
by B that are siblings of elements matched by A and appear after them.
`h2 ~ p` selects all <p> elements that are siblings of <h2> elements and appear after them.


Adjacent sibling combinator/Next-sibling combinator ("+" --> A + B): Selects the first element matched 
by B that is immediately preceded by an element matched by A.
`h2 + p` selects the first <p> element that comes immediately after an <h2> element.
