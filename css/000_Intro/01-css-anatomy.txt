CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what we use to selectively style HTML elements. 


selector {
  property_name1: value; (Declaration)
  property_name2: value; (Declaration)
  ...
}

The whole structure is called a ruleset. 
(The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.)

Selector: The selector defines which HTML elements the styles should be applied to. 
Selectors can target elements by their tag name(tag selector or element selector), 
class(class selector), ID(id selector), attribute(attribute selector), or relationship
to other elements(Combinators).


- Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces 
called Declaration block. ({})
- Within each declaration, we must use a colon (:) to separate the property from 
its value or values.
- Within each ruleset, we must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration 
from the next one.
