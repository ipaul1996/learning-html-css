  /* It adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects 
  separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the 
  element, blur and spread radius, and color.

  box-shadow: red 60px -16px; <color> | <offset-X> | <offset-Y>
  box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px black; <offset-X> | <offset-Y> | <blur-radius> | <color>

  box-shadow: 3px 3px red, -1em 0 .4em olive;

  <color> --> Optional
  <offset-x> --> (horizontal offset)
  <offset-y> --> (vertical offset)
  Negative <offset-x> value places the shadow to the left of the element. 
  Negative <offset-y> value places the shadow above the element.

  If not specified, the value of 0 is used for the missing length. If both <offset-x> and <offset-y> are set to 0, the shadow is placed behind the element (and may generate a blur effect if <blur-radius> and/or <spread-radius> is set).

  <blur-radius> --> The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter. Negative values are not allowed. If not specified, it will be set to 0 (meaning that the shadow's edge will be sharp).

  <spread-radius> --> Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, negative values will cause the shadow to shrink. If not specified, it will be set to 0 (that is, the shadow will be the same size as the element).

  /* 
  auto, width-to-height ratio

  It allows us to define the desired width-to-height ratio of an element's box. 
  This means that even if the parent container or viewport size changes, the browser 
  will adjust the element's dimensions to maintain the specified width-to-height ratio.
  At least one of the box's sizes needs to be automatic in order for aspect-ratio to have 
  any effect. If neither the width nor height is an automatic size, then the provided 
  aspect ratio has no effect on the box's preferred sizes.

  auto: Replaced elements with an intrinsic aspect ratio use that aspect ratio, 
  otherwise the box has no preferred aspect ratio. Size calculations involving 
  intrinsic aspect ratio always work with the content box dimensions.

  width-to-height ratio:  [1/1, 1, 3/2, 0.5, 16/9 etc.]
  If height and the preceding slash character are omitted, 
  height defaults to 1.
  
  fallback to 'auto' for replaced elements,
  aspect-ratio: auto 3/4;
  aspect-ratio: 9/6 auto;

    An outline is a line that is drawn around an element, outside the border. Unlike the

    of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by 
    the width of the outline. They also don't support rounded corners like borders do.
