/* box-sizing */

The alternate CSS box model:-
In this model, the width and height of an element include the padding and 
border. This means that the specified width and height of the element 
include the padding and border, and the content area is adjusted to fit within 
those dimensions. It is implemented with box-sizing: border-box.

Specifying Dimensions: When we set the width and height of an element using the alternate box model, 
we're specifying the total outer dimensions of the box, including padding and borders.

Content Sizing: The content area of the element is adjusted to fit within the specified 
width and height, accounting for any padding and borders. This means that the content area 
may be smaller than the specified width and height if padding and borders are present.

Padding and Border Widths: Padding and border widths are included in the specified width 
and height of the element. This ensures that the total outer dimensions of the box remain 
consistent, regardless of padding and border widths.

.box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}

content box width = 350px - (2 * 25px) - (2 * 5px) = 290px;
content box height = 150px - (2 * 25px) - (2 * 5px) = 90px;

In the case of the standard box model, the value for box-sizing is 'content-box'.
This is the default value. When using this setting, the width and height of an element only apply to its content area. Padding and borders are added outside this defined width and height, increasing the overall size of the box. This means that if you set an element’s width to 100%, and also apply padding and borders, the total width of the box will exceed 100% of its parent element.

.content-box {
    box-sizing: content-box;
    width: 200px; /* Content area width */
    padding: 20px; /* Padding added outside */
    border: 5px solid; /* Border added outside */
}

We can also use padding-box, although this value is less commonly used. It includes the padding in the box’s dimensions but excludes the border. This can lead to confusion and is not as straightforward as the other two options.
