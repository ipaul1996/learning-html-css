/* box-sizing */

The alternate CSS box model:-
In this model the width and height of an element include the padding and 
border. This means that the specified width and height of the element 
include the padding and border, and the content area is adjusted to fit within 
those dimensions. It is implemented with box-sizing: border-box.

Specifying Dimensions: When we set the width and height of an element using the alternate box model, 
we're specifying the total outer dimensions of the box, including padding and borders.

Content Sizing: The content area of the element is adjusted to fit within the specified 
width and height, accounting for any padding and borders. This means that the content area 
may be smaller than the specified width and height if padding and borders are present.

Padding and Border Widths: Padding and border widths are included in the specified width 
and height of the element. This ensures that the total outer dimensions of the box remain 
consistent, regardless of padding and border widths.

.box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 350px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}

content box width = 350px - (2 * 25px) - (2 * 5px) = 290px;
content box height = 150px - (2 * 25px) - (2 * 5px) = 90px;
