/* object-fit, object-position */


In CSS, a replaced element is one whose content comes from an external source and is not influenced by the document's styles. This means that while you can style the layout and positioning of these elements (like margins and padding), the actual content itself cannot be altered through CSS. Common examples of replaced elements include `<img>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<iframe>`, `<input>`, `<canvas>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>`. Understanding replaced elements is crucial for embedding external resources in web applications, as they allow for the inclusion of various media types and user input forms without the content being affected by CSS styling .

***************************************************************************************
object-fit:
The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container.

values: 
contain - The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box.

cover - The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. If the object's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be clipped to fit.

fill - The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. The entire object will completely fill the box. If the object's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be stretched to fit.

none - The replaced content is not resized.

scale-down - The content is sized as if none or contain were specified, whichever would result in a smaller concrete object size.

***************************************************************************************

object-position - The object-position CSS property specifies the alignment of the selected replaced element's contents within the element's box. Areas of the box which aren't covered by the replaced element's object will show the element's background.

values - keyword values(top, right, bottom, left, center), <percentage> values, <length> values
object-position: 50% 50%;
object-position: right top;
object-position: left top;
object-position: 250px 125px;
