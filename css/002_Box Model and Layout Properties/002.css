  /*
  The overflow property controls how content behaves when it exceeds the size of 
  its parent element's box, handling both horizontal (overflow-x) and vertical 
  (overflow-y) directions.

  Constituent Properties:
  - overflow-x: Controls the horizontal overflow (left to right).
  - overflow-y: Controls the vertical overflow (top to bottom).

  Shorthand:
  - Specifying one value sets both overflow-x and overflow-y.
  - Specifying two values: first applies to overflow-x, second to overflow-y 
    (e.g., overflow: hidden visible;).
    
  Values:
  - visible: (Default) Content is not clipped and can overflow the element's box.
  - hidden: Overflow is clipped, and excess content is invisible.
  - scroll: Overflow is clipped, and scrollbars are added to access content.
  - auto: Behaves like 'scroll', but scrollbars only appear if content overflows.
