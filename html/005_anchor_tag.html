    <!-- The download attribute is used in the <a> (anchor) tag in HTML to specify that the target resource should be downloaded when the link is clicked, instead of navigating to it. This attribute is particularly useful when you want to provide a link to a downloadable file, such as a PDF document, image, video, or any other type of file. -->

<!-- href: Specifies the URL of the destination page or resource. It can be an absolute URL or a relative URL. -->

<!-- The target attribute in HTML is used within anchor <a> tags to specify where the linked document should be displayed when the link is clicked. 
_self: The default behavior. Opens the linked document in the same browsing context or window as the current document.
_blank: Opens the linked document in a new browsing context or tab/window. This is commonly used for links that should open in a separate tab or window to avoid navigating away from the current page. 
_parent: The parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as _self.
_top: The topmost browsing context. To be specific, this means the "highest" context that's an ancestor of the current one. If no ancestors, behaves as _self.
