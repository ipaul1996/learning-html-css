    <pre>
        This is some      preformatted text.
        It will be displayed exactly as it is written,
        with line breaks and spaces preserved. 
    </pre>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- The <pre> tag defines preformatted text. Text in a <pre> element 
is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces 
and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the 
HTML source code. -->
